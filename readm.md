# âœ¨ Game Of Life

The Game of Life is based on a 2D grid. In its initial state there are cells which are either alive or dead. We generate the next generation of cells according to only four rules:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies as if caused by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
